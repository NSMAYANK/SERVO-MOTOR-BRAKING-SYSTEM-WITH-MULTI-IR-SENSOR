# SERVO-MOTOR-BRAKING-SYSTEM-WITH-MULTI-IR-SENSOR
This project uses five IR sensors to detect obstacles and control a servo motor for braking. When an obstacle is detected, the servo applies the brake, and a relay stops the motor. Once the obstacle is cleared, the servo releases the brake, and the motor resumes, ensuring safety in automation and robotics.
